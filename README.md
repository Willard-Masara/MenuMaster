This is a tool that scours restaurant sites in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg so that customers do not have to worry about having to expend their energy pouring over restaurants menus. Here they are brought together for the convenience of it.

The tech Stack ~BACKEND
-Python
	used the Flask library to for the server for this project 
	used regexes, bs4 library to implement the core functionality of the web scraping tool


~Database
	employed sql in the sqlite db that I employed here
	chosen for its simplisity


The tech Stack ~FRONTEND
~HTML

	the core functionality of the front end rests on an html file in the static folder. It is rendered on the home page that is invoked by the server


~JavaScript React
	employed react to add interactivity to the application, with its use being to add the onclick functionality to the application


~CSS
	employed css to style the application


SCALING THE APPLICATION 

~ IMPLEMENTING A REVIEW FUNCTIONALITY
	it would go well to add the ability to comment/ review food on this tool. To implement this would mean integrating such with the db and having a button for review on the front end


~ TESTING
	I belive in TDD, and so will implement tests for the core functionality of the app, namely app.py and scraper.py in the backend.
	

~ ADDING MORE RESTAURANTS AND DEPLOYMENT
	I intend to add more restaurants and fine tune my tool for deployment on netlify
